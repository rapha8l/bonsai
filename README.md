# bonsai

<img align="right" src="res/bonsai.png">

A tiny Linux distribution focused on simplicity.

Linux done differently.

For the idealists, for the hobbyists.

### Notice February 2020

Project has been put on hold until further notice.  
Thanks to all who have contributed.

# Core Philosophy

### *"Software shouldn't come with compromise."*

1. **Static Linking**
 
All programs are statically linked.  
No [dependency hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell), no searching through the filesystem.  
Moving parts are minimized. Simpler is better.

2. **Sandboxing**

Chroot sandboxes should be *dead simple* to 
setup simply by copying statically-linked binaries.

Running a chrooted service can be as easy as `chroot /src/pkgs/myapp /bin/myapp`

3. **A Better C Library**

GNU's [glibc](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc) is massively bloated and a poor choice for static linking.  
[musl-libc](http://musl-libc.org) is a fresh lightweight alternative 
that was [designed from the ground up](https://www.musl-libc.org/intro.html) 
to be used with static linking. 

Just take a look at this [hello world](http://bonsai-linux.org/uploads/hello_world.png) for a size comparison.

Applications statically-linked with musl carefully avoid pulling 
in large amounts of code or data that the application will not 
use and have no runtime dependencies. Many programs need 
patching to compile under musl-libc, however this 
*almost always* makes their code [better](http://wiki.musl-libc.org/bugs-found-by-musl.html).

4. **Simplicity**

No matter how great, a system is hindered by its ability to be understood.

* A modular automated build system with parts that can overridden simply by defining the given function in the [pkgfile](http://github.com/bonsai-linux/bonsai/blob/master/ports/extra/loksh/pkgfile)
* Easy-to-understand "3-phase" `prebuild()`, `build()`, and `postbuild()`
* Automatic detection of required [flags](http://github.com/bonsai-linux/bonsai/blob/master/ports/core/%40cfg/config/build.cfg), [configs](https://github.com/bonsai-linux/bonsai/blob/master/ports/core/%40cfg/config/autotools.cfg), patches, and workarounds  
* Extensive documentation, with unclear or missing manuals considered a bug *(TODO)*
* Stay under [1000 SLOC](http://bonsai-linux.org/uploads/under_1000_sloc-Sept-08-19.png)

5. **Sane File System Hierarchy**

Similar to [GoboLinux](https://gobolinux.org/), bonsai uses a custom directory scheme:

`/include`  
`/lib`  
`/share`  
`/local` <sub>(applications not installed via bonsai)</sub>  
`/src` <sub>(bonsai home)</sub>  
`/usr ` <sub>symlinked ‚Üí   `/`</sub>  
`/sbin` <sub>symlinked ‚Üí `/bin`</sub>  

*(directories left standard not shown)*

----

A tree of `/src` looks like this:

```
/src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /config      ‚Üê  config files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /pkgs        ‚Üê  packages
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /ports       ‚Üê  pkgfiles
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /sources     ‚Üê  tarballs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bonsai.rc    ‚Üê  config file
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bonsai.db    ‚Üê  database file
```

Inside each package in `pkgs` is its own prefix with given `/bin`, `/lib`, etc

As a side effect of this, each `$pkg` is its own chroot filesystem that can
be used at will.  
In the future, this process is planned to be automated.

Symlinks are created from the package to the outside root for seamless
integration and standards compatibility.

<sub>**Example:**</sub>

```sh
% readlink /bin/perl
/src/pkgs/perl/bin/perl
% readlink /share/man/man1/gcc.1
/src/pkgs/gcc/share/man1/gcc.1
```

With only symlinks, no actual data lives in 
`/bin`, `/lib`, `/include`, or `/share` on the root.

Thus removing data is as simple as removing a given `$pkgdir` from `/src/pkgs`.  
The symlinks are then tracked and removed once the program is uninstalled.

6. **Lightweight**
